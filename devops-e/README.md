# DevOps Applied to Everything

This project originated from a request to discuss the application of DevOps at
Cray. Part of my role involved addressing the question: *What should DevOps look
like at Cray, particularly for the teams I supported?* This inquiry naturally
expanded into a broader consideration: *What should DevOps look like for any
given project?* As a multipotentialite, I was further intrigued by the
possibility that the principles of DevOps, along with the continuous improvement
methodologies that preceded and influenced the DevOps movement, could be applied
beyond their traditional domains.

This project aims to examine the fundamental principles underlying DevOps and
related methodologies, identifying the key factors that contribute to both
success and failure. Additionally, it seeks to explore how these principles can
be extended to other disciplines, fostering opportunities for cross-disciplinary
learning. Through discussions with industry leaders and practitioners, the
project endeavors to uncover insights and best practices that can drive
continuous improvement. By analyzing both parallel and contrasting methodologies
across diverse fields, the ultimate goal is to develop a more comprehensive,
interdisciplinary understanding of productive cultures and effective practices.

The extent to which the concept of "everything" can be extended within this
project remains an open question.

Historically, a set of groundbreaking ideas led to significant successes across
several professional fields. Some of these ideas have since been adapted to
more contemporary challenges, occasionally yielding transformative outcomes. It
is possible that continuous improvement processes, along with their iterative
refinements, could be applied recursively, further enhancing their efficacy.

The term "DevOps" in the project title is tentative. Today, DevOps primarily
refers to modern cloud software development practices. Other terms such as
**Kaizen** or **Lean**, commonly used in manufacturing and high technology,
could be equally relevant. More broadly, this project aims to extend insights
beyond these industries—even beyond the professional world itself.
Furthermore, if analogous frameworks emerge in entirely different contexts,
can engineering-oriented fields derive valuable lessons from them?

Many of the concepts explored in this project are not novel, yet they may
require reconsideration from a different perspective. From everything to
everything—how do we optimize processes, and what ultimately defines success?

This project involves extensive research, critical analysis, and in-depth
discussions with professionals, alongside practical and experimental
applications designed to test and refine these ideas.

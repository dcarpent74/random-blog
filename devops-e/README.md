# DevOps Applied to Everything

This project was inspired after being asked if I could talk about what DevOps
looked like at Cray. My job was, in part, to answer the question what should
DevOps look like at Cray, and more specifically for the teams I supported. That
naturally led to the question, "What should DevOps look like for any particular
project?" And as a multipotentialite, this quickly led to the idea that perhaps
something like "DevOps" can be applied to everything.

It aspires to explore the core principles behind DevOps and other related
practices and understand the underlying factors that lead to success and reasons
for failure. It seeks to investigate the application of these principles to
other disciplines and seek opportunities for cross-pollination learning. By
engaging in discussion with leaders and practitioners this project aims to gain
insights and share best-practices to find opportunities for continuous
improvement. By exploring the parallel and contrasting practices across various
fields, the goal is to produce an enhanced and interdisciplinary understanding
of productive cultures and practices.

It is  still unclear if there are any limits to what can be included in the
notion of "everything."

The potential of a variety of great ideas made for huge successes in the past.
In more recent years these ideas were translated for modern endeavors
occasionally making for the huge success stories of today. Perhaps continuous
improvement processes and the translation of them can be turned in upon
themselves.

What can we learn from DevOps outside of manufacturing and high-tech? And if we
build or find something like DevOps in some far removed context, are there
lessons there that engineering oriented fields can learn?

Many of the ideas I am looking at here are not new, but perhaps we have yet to
think about these ideas in the proper way. From everything and to everything...
How do we get things right? And what is success ultimately?

Work for this project includes significant reading, writing, thinking, deep
discussions with other professionals, and includes some practical or
experimental projects to work through these ideas.

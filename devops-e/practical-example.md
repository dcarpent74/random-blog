## [DevOps Applied to Everything](README.md)

# A practical example you might apply to many things

This struck me as just an awesome practice and example of “DevOps done right”...
And to me it seemed like an excellent example that can be used as a model for
bootstrapping your own projects whether at work or in community building or
otherwise. I’ve already shared this around, and have had the people I shared it
with share it along further as well as comment on how helpful it is and how
much trans formative potential is in this talk. It is a little bit tech
oriented, but not so much so. If you’ve ever used an electronic ticket system
you probably can understand what is going on here, and the point of the talk is
about on-boarding new employees, building and improving a healthy collaborative
culture, and encouraging healthy documentation habits within that culture.

A version of the presentation is part of the 2021 DevOps Days Texas conference
which was recorded as a couple big long YouTube videos:
[Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji_Dl92D6ps) and
[Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvuWHRPqcCA).

The presentation is buried at about 6h 9m into Day 1.

There is also a blog post which is perhaps more business-technical but about the
same process here:

[How Contrast Simplified and Streamlined Its New Hire Onboarding Process](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/how-contrast-simplified-and-streamlined-its-new-hire-onboarding-process)

If the blog post at all piques your interest then listening to the talk is well
worth your time. The talk is both more accessible and makes some really great
points. If you are part of an engineering team, the whole thing is definitely a
gem!

I have already used this as a model to create my own bootstrap for my own
personal documentation project at work, and plan to use it to create bootstraps
for a couple of my “DevOps applied to everything” projects that I have been
percolating in my head and in my conversations for the last year.

If you find this useful, and especially if you put the ides to use in a more
innovative non-engineering way, I’d love to hear from you. I plan to feature
this kind of cross-discipline adaptations of ideas like this as part of my
various “DevOps applied to everything” projects.

Just a place to write about random thoughts that I want to make public.

I've decided to create a blog-repository here simply because I have nothing
better that I use on a regular basis.  It does not need to look pretty, though
I could do github.io hosting with markdown and get pretty good results.  I am
not currently using a social media site or trying to monetize though maybe I
should (constructive feedback on this would be appreciated).  I simply want a
a place to post my thoughts to share with others in a place that is familiar and
easy for me to use, and GitHub is such a place.

Eventually, I will probably figure other stuff out and move on to something
more "real" as a solution, but for the time being I can post here, and it "just
works."
